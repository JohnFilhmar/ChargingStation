# EcoCharge: An Eco-Friendly Charging Station

## Project Overview
EcoCharge is an innovative, solar-powered charging station designed to provide a sustainable and efficient solution for charging electronic devices. Developed for the College of Computer Studies at Mindoro State University â€“ Calapan City Campus, the project combines renewable energy technology with user-friendly features to promote environmental sustainability and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

## Key Features
- **Solar-Powered**: Utilizes a 300-watt solar panel to harness renewable energy, minimizing the environmental impact.
- **Energy Storage**: Includes a lithium-ion battery pack to store energy for consistent power supply during non-sunny periods.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Features an OLED display to provide real-time updates on battery levels, solar input, and charging status.
- **Smart Features**: Incorporates barcode scanning for user identification and charging activity logging.
- **Multi-Device Charging**: Equipped with multiple USB ports to charge various devices simultaneously.

## Objectives
1. Implement solar panels as the primary power source to promote clean energy.
2. Provide real-time updates through a web application for enhanced user experience.
3. Improve accessibility and availability of charging stations for students and staff.

## Components Used
- **300-Watt Solar Panel**: Captures solar energy to generate electricity.
- **LiFePO4 Battery Pack**: Stores energy for continuous operation.
- **Solar Charge Controller**: Manages the charging process and ensures efficiency.
- **OLED Display**: Displays charging status and system updates.
- **Barcode Scanner**: Tracks user activity for usage insights.
- **USB Host Shield and Ports**: Facilitates charging of multiple devices simultaneously.

## Benefits
- **Sustainability**: Reduces carbon footprint by leveraging renewable energy.
- **Cost-Effective**: Decreases electricity costs for the campus.
- **Educational Impact**: Promotes awareness of renewable energy among students and staff.
- **Convenience**: Offers reliable and accessible charging infrastructure.

## Installation
The charging station is installed in the IT Tambayan at Mindoro State University. Its optimal location ensures maximum sunlight exposure and easy access for IT students.

## Future Enhancements
- Explore larger solar panel setups for higher capacity.
- Integrate advanced energy storage technologies like supercapacitors.
- Expand the charging network to other campus locations.
